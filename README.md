# Multi-buildpack

Use multiple buildpacks on your app.

## Usage

Scalingo automatically detects an application to be multi-buildpack as long as there is a `.buildpacks` file at its root. For further details on using multiple buildpacks, please refer to [our documentation](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/buildpacks/multi).
